英：Since we are going to use the terms “credit” and “debt”a lot, I’d like to start with what they are and how they work.

译：在本书中，我会频繁使用“信贷”和“债务”两个词，因此有必要从一开始就厘清这两个概念及其背后的原理。

英：Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is
debt. Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good thing, and not
providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing. For example, if there is very little credit provided
for development, then there is very little development, which is a bad thing. The problem with debt arises when there is
an inability to pay it back. Said differently, the question of whether rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing
hinges on what that credit produces and how the debt is repaid (i.e., how the debt is serviced).

译：信贷是指赋予他人购买力，他人承诺今后偿还该购买力，即偿还债务。显然，以信贷的方式赋予他人购买力，这本身是一件好事。相反地，不赋予他人购买力，
使其无法去做有益的事，可能会产生不利的后果。因信贷不足而导致发展缓慢，无疑是件坏事。当债务人无力偿还债务时，就会产生债务问题。

换言之，判断信贷/债务快速增长是好事还是坏事，取决于信贷产生的结果和债务偿还情况。

英：Almost by definition, financially responsible people don’t like having much debt. I understand that perspective well
because I share it. For my whole life, even when I didn’t have any money, I strongly preferred saving to
borrowing, because I felt that the upsides of debt weren’t worth its downsides[^1], which is a
perspective I presume I got from my dad. I identify with people who believe that taking on a little debt is better than
taking on a lot. But over
time I learned that that’s not necessarily true, especially for society as a whole (as distinct from individuals),
because those who make policy for society have controls that individuals don’t. From my experiences and my research, I
have learned that too little credit/debt growth can create as bad or worse economic problems as having too much, with
the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities.

译：在财务上持谨慎态度的人生性不喜欢大量借债。我非常理解这种想法，因为我也是这样。在我一生中，即使在财务状况极为紧张的时候，我也宁愿存钱而不喜欢借钱，
因为我觉得借钱的坏处大于好处，这可能是我从父亲那里习得的观念。对于认为少量借债比大量借债要好的看法，我是认同的。但后来，我发现这种看法也不一定对，
尤其是对整个社会（而非个人）而言，因为社会政策的制定者比个人更有控制能力。我的经验和研究告诉我，相比信贷/债务增长过快，其增长过慢导致的经济问题同样严重，
甚至会更糟糕，因为信贷/债务增长过慢的代价就是会错失发展机会。

英：Generally speaking, because credit creates both spending power and debt, whether or not more credit is desirable
depends on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient income to service the debt. If
that occurs,the resources will have been well allocated and both the lender and the borrower will benefit economically.
If that doesn’t occur,the borrowers and the lenders won’t be satisfied and there’s a good chance that the resources were
poorly allocated.

译：总的来说，由于信贷同时创造了购买力和债务，因此增加信贷是好是坏，取决于能否把借款用于生产性目的，从而创造出足够多的收入来还本付息。如果能够实现这一点，
资源就得到了良好的配置，债权人和债务人都能从中获利。否则，双方都不满意，资源配置很可能就不甚理想。

译：从整个社会来看，除了要判断信贷的第一层（直接的）经济效果外，还需要考虑其第二层（间接的）经济效果。比如，在教育好下一代（良好的教育可以提高劳动生产率，减少犯罪，降低执法成本）
和替换低效的基础设施等成本效益显著的事情上，有时投入的资金或信贷不足。这是因为财政保守主义者认为举债做这种事对社会不利，但这种观点并不正确。
