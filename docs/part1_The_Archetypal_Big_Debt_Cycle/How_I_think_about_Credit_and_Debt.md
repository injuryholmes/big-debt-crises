# 我如何看待信贷和债务

(我如何看待信贷和债务)

英：Since we are going to use the terms “credit” and “debt”a lot, I’d like to start with what they are and how they work.

中：在本书中，我会频繁使用“信贷”和“债务”两个词，因此有必要从一开始就厘清这两个概念及其背后的原理。

---

英：Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is
debt. Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good thing, and not
providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing. For example, if there is very little credit provided
for development, then there is very little development, which is a bad thing. The problem with debt arises when there is
an inability to pay it back. Said differently, the question of whether rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing
hinges on what that credit produces and how the debt is repaid (i.e., how the debt is serviced).

中：信贷是指赋予他人购买力，他人承诺今后偿还该购买力，即偿还债务。显然，以信贷的方式赋予他人购买力，这本身是一件好事。相反地，不赋予他人购买力，
使其无法去做有益的事，可能会产生不利的后果。因信贷不足而导致发展缓慢，无疑是件坏事。当债务人无力偿还债务时，就会产生债务问题。

换言之，判断信贷/债务快速增长是好事还是坏事，取决于信贷产生的结果和债务偿还情况。

英：Almost by definition, financially responsible people don’t like having much debt. I understand that perspective well
because I share it. For my whole life, even when I didn’t have any money, I strongly preferred saving to
borrowing, because I felt that the upsides of debt weren’t worth its downsides[^1], which is a
perspective I presume I got from my dad. I identify with people who believe that taking on a little debt is better than
taking on a lot. But over
time I learned that that’s not necessarily true, especially for society as a whole (as distinct from individuals),
because those who make policy for society have controls that individuals don’t. From my experiences and my research, I
have learned that too little credit/debt growth can create as bad or worse economic problems as having too much, with
the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities.

[^1]: 借债行为在经济上行周期的收益与经济下行周期的压力相比，不值得；参考[《经济机器是怎么运行的》](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15s411b7xr/)

中：在财务上持谨慎态度的人生性不喜欢大量借债。我非常理解这种想法，因为我也是这样。在我一生中，即使在财务状况极为紧张的时候，我也宁愿存钱而不喜欢借钱，
因为我觉得借钱的坏处大于好处，这可能是我从父亲那里习得的观念。对于认为少量借债比大量借债要好的看法，我是认同的。但后来，我发现这种看法也不一定对，
尤其是对整个社会（而非个人）而言，因为社会政策的制定者比个人更有控制能力。我的经验和研究告诉我，相比信贷/债务增长过快，其增长过慢导致的经济问题同样严重，
甚至会更糟糕，因为信贷/债务增长过慢的代价就是会错失发展机会。

---
英：Generally speaking, because credit creates both spending power and debt, whether or not more credit is desirable
depends on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient income to service the debt. If
that occurs,the resources will have been well allocated and both the lender and the borrower will benefit economically.
If that doesn’t occur,the borrowers and the lenders won’t be satisfied and there’s a good chance that the resources were
poorly allocated.

中：总的来说，由于信贷同时创造了购买力和债务，因此增加信贷是好是坏，取决于能否把借款用于生产性目的，从而创造出足够多的收入来还本付息。如果能够实现这一点，
资源就得到了良好的配置，债权人和债务人都能从中获利。否则，双方都不满意，资源配置很可能就不甚理想。

---

英：In assessing this for society as a whole, one should consider the secondary/indirect economics as well as the more
primary/direct economics. For example, sometimes not enough money/credit is provided for such obviously cost-effective
things as educating our children well (which would make them more productive, while reducing crime and the costs of
incarceration), or replacing inefficient infrastructure, because of a fiscal conservativism that insists that borrowing
to do such things is bad for society, which is not true.

中：从整个社会来看，除了要判断信贷的第一层（直接的）经济效果外，还需要考虑其第二层（间接的）经济效果。比如，在教育好下一代（良好的教育可以提高劳动生产率，减少犯罪，降低执法成本）
和替换低效的基础设施等成本效益显著的事情上，有时投入的资金或信贷不足。这是因为财政保守主义者认为举债做这种事对社会不利，但这种观点并不正确。


---

英：I want to be clear that credit/debt that produces enough economic benefit to pay for itself is a good thing. But
sometimes the trade-offs are harder to see. If lending standards are so tight that they require a near certainty of
being paid back, that may lead to fewer debt problems but too little development. If the lending standards are looser,
that could lead to more development but could also create serious debt problems down the road that erase the
benefits. Let’s look at this and a few other common questions about debt and debt cycles.

中：因此，我想明确指出的是，如果信贷/债务能产生足够大的经济效益，能使债务得到偿还，则信贷/债务是件好事。但有时，信贷/债务的代价是我们难以看清的。
贷款标准过严，债务人几乎铁定能偿还债务，很少会产生债务问题，但缺点是经济发展不足。贷款标准宽松，可能会促进经济发展，但之后可能带来严重的债务问题，
使已经取得的经济成果化为乌有。以下是关于债务和债务周期的一些常见问题。

## 与拒绝借债相比，不良债务的代价几何？

(How Costly Is Bad Debt Relative to Not Having the Spending that the Debt Is Financing?)

英：Suppose that you, as a policy maker, choose to build a subway system that costs $1 billion. You finance it with debt
that you expect to be paid back from revenue, but the economics turn out to be so much worse than you expected that only
half of the expected revenues come in.The debt has to be written down by 50 percent. Does that mean you shouldn’t have
built the subway?

中：假设你是一位决策者，决定建造一个耗资10亿美元的地铁系统，建设资金来源于贷款并计划用地铁运营收入偿还。但后来，地铁运营效益远远低于预期，
收入只有预期的一半，因此债务不得不减记50%。这是否意味着当初不应当建造该地铁系统呢？

---

英：Rephrased, the question is whether the subway system is worth $500 million more than what was initially budgeted,or,
on an annual basis, whether it is worth about 2 percent more per year than budgeted[^2], supposing the subway system has
a
25-year lifespan. Looked at this way, you may well assess that having the subway system at that cost is a lot better
than not having the subway system.

[^2]: (1+2%)^25 = 1.64; 即地铁的价值在25年后会增值约64%；作者此处将64% ≈ 50%

中：换种问法，该地铁系统的实际造价是否比当初的预算高出5亿美元？或者说，假设该地铁系统的运营年限为25年，分摊到每年，其造价是否每年增长2%？这样来看，
你很可能会认为付出这些成本是值得的，建造该地铁系统比不建要好得多。

---

英：To give you an idea of what that might mean for an economy as a whole, really bad debt losses have been when roughly
40 percent of a loan’s value couldn’t be paid back. Those bad loans amount to about 20 percent of all the outstanding
loans, so the losses are equal to about 8 percent of total debt. That total debt, in turn, is equal to about 200 percent
of income (e.g. GDP), so the shortfall is roughly equal to 16 percent of GDP. If that cost is “socialized” (i.e., borne
by the society as a whole via fiscal and/or monetary policies) and spread over 15 years,it would amount to about 1
percent per year, which is tolerable. Of course, if not spread out, the costs would be intolerable. For that reason, I
am asserting that the downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the
ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts.I have seen this in all the cases I have lived
through and studied. Whether policy makers can do this depends on two factors: 1) whether the debt is denominated in the
currency that they control and 2) whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.

中：这对一个经济体而言到底意味着什么？当大约40%的贷款无法被偿还时就会出现实际的坏账损失，而那些不良贷款占全部未偿贷款的20%左右。
因此，坏账损失大约相当于总债务的8%。而总债务大约为总收入［例如，以GDP（国内生产总值）计］的200%，故坏账损失大约相当于GDP的16%。如果以15年为限，
将此损失“社会化”（通过财政政策和货币政策让全社会分担），则每年的损失为GDP的1%左右，这个规模是可以接受的。当然，如果不分摊到每年，该损失会令人无法接受。
因此，我认为，大量举债的风险主要在于决策者是否有意愿和能力将坏账损失分摊到多年。在我经历和研究的所有案例中，我都看到了这种情况。
决策者能不能做到这一点，取决于两个因素：（1）债务是否以决策者能够控制的货币计价；（2）决策者能否对债权人和债务人施加影响。

## 债务危机是不可避免的吗？

(Are Debt Crises Inevitable?)

英：Throughout history only a few well-disciplined countries have avoided debt crises. That’s because lending is never
done perfectly and is often done badly due to how the cycle affects people’s psychology to produce bubbles and busts.
While policy makers generally try to get it right, more often than not they err on the side of being too loose with
credit because the near-term rewards (faster growth) seem to justify it. It is also politically easier to allow easy
credit (e.g., by providing guarantees, easing monetary policies) than to have tight credit. That is the main reason we
see big debt cycles.

中：历史上，只有少数自律性良好的国家能够避免债务危机的发生。贷款过程不可能永远一帆风顺，常常伴随各种问题，因为贷款周期会影响人们的心理，
从而导致泡沫的形成和破裂。尽管决策者一般都想尽力妥善行事，但很多时候由于短期回报（提高经济增长率）看似合理，会出现信贷过于宽松的状况。
从政治角度看，放宽信贷（例如，提供还款保证、放宽货币政策等）比收紧信贷更容易。这是产生债务大周期的主要原因。

---

## 债务危机为何有周期性？

英：I find that whenever I start talking about cycles,particularly big, long-term cycles, people’s eyebrows go up; the
reactions I elicit are similar to those I’d expect if I were talking about astrology. For that reason, I want to
emphasize that I am talking about nothing more than logically-driven series of events that recur in patterns. In a
market-based economy, expansions and contractions in credit drive economic cycles, which occur for perfectly logical
reasons. Though the patterns are similar, the sequences are neither pre-destined to repeat in exactly the same ways nor
to take exactly the same amount of time.

中：我发现，每当我说起周期，特别是大周期、长周期时，人们都会惊讶不已，仿佛我在跟他们讲占星术一样。因此，我想强调的是，
我讲的周期无非是一系列合乎逻辑、以固定模式反复发生的事件。在市场经济中，信贷扩张和信贷收缩推动经济周期的发展，其背后有完美的逻辑支撑。
尽管各个周期的规律相似，但它们重现的方式和持续的时间不会完全相同。

---

英：To put these complicated matters into very simple terms,you create a cycle virtually anytime you borrow money.Buying
something you can’t afford means spending more than you make. You’re not just borrowing from your lender; you are
borrowing from your future self.Essentially, you are creating a time in the future in which you will need to spend less
than you make so you can pay it back. The pattern of borrowing, spending more than you make, and then having to spend
less than you make very quickly resembles a cycle. This is as true for a national economy as it is for an individual.
Borrowing money sets a mechanical, predictable series of events into motion.

中：化繁为简地讲，在任何时候，你一旦借钱，就会创造出一个周期。买一件你目前买不起的东西，你的消费必然会超出你的收入。借款时，你不仅是在向贷款人借钱，
你实际上是在向未来的自己借钱。在未来的某个时候，你必须要降低消费水平，以偿还债务。这种先借款消费、后紧缩开支的模式与周期非常相似。对个人来说是这样，
对一国经济而言也是如此。一旦借款，就启动了一系列机械性的、可预测的事件。

---

英：If you understand the game of Monopoly®, you can pretty well understand how credit cycles work on the level of a
whole economy. Early in the game, people have a lot of cash and only a few properties, so it pays to convert your cash
into property. As the game progresses and players acquire more and more houses and hotels, more and more cash is needed
to pay the rents that are charged when you land on a property that has a lot of them. Some players are forced to sell
their property at discounted prices to raise that cash. So early in the game, “property is king” and later in the game,
“cash is king.” Those who play the game best understand how to hold the right mix of property and cash as the game
progresses.

中：如果你玩过《大富翁》游戏，就很好理解债务周期在一国经济层面是如何运作的。游戏开始时，玩家手握大量现金，只有少量房地产，因此把现金换成房地产很划算。
随着游戏的进行，玩家买入越来越多的房屋和酒店，当玩家停在别人的房地产上时，需要越来越多的现金来支付租金。这时，有的玩家被迫低价出售房地产来换取现金。
因此，游戏初期是“房地产为王”，后期则是“现金为王”。擅长玩这款游戏的人都知道如何在游戏过程中建立房地产和现金的最佳组合。

---

英：Now, let’s imagine how this Monopoly® game would work if we allowed the bank to make loans and take deposits. Players
would be able to borrow money to buy property, and, rather than holding their cash idly, they would deposit it at the
bank to earn interest, which in turn would provide the bank with more money to lend. Let’s also imagine that players in
this game could buy and sell properties from each other on credit (i.e., by promising to pay back the money with
interest at a later date). If Monopoly® were played this way, it would provide an almost perfect model for the way our
economy operates. The amount of debt-financed spending on hotels would quickly grow to multiples of the amount of money
in existence. Down the road, the debtors who hold those hotels will become short on the cash they need to pay their
rents and service their debt. The bank will also get into trouble as their depositors’ rising need for cash will cause
them to withdraw it, even as more and more debtors are falling behind on their payments. If nothing is done to
intervene, both banks and debtors will go broke and the economy will contract. Over time, as these cycles of expansion
and contraction occur repeatedly, the conditions are created for a big, long-term debt crisis.

中：现在，假设银行可以提供贷款，接收存款，游戏又会怎样发展？玩家可以借钱购买房地产，而把闲置资金存入银行以赚取利息，这反过来使银行可以放出更多的贷款。
再假设游戏中的玩家可以通过信贷购买和出售房地产，承诺以后还本付息。如果《大富翁》的游戏规则变成这样，就几乎完美地复制了生活中的经济运行模式。
举债购买酒店的资金数额会迅速增加，变成现有资金的数倍。而未来，持有这些酒店的债务人因要支付租金和偿债而面临现金紧缺的局面。
银行也将陷入困境，因为存款人对现金的需求不断增加，要从银行取出现金，用于支付租金，偿还债务，而越来越多的债务人则难以按时还款。如果不采取干预措施，
银行和债务人都将破产，经济将出现萎缩。随着时间的推移，这些经济扩张和经济萎缩循环反复发生，为长期性债务大危机创造了条件。

英：Lending naturally creates self-reinforcing upward movements that eventually reverse to create self-reinforcing
downward movements that must reverse in turn. During the upswings, lending supports spending and investment, which in
turn supports incomes and asset prices; increased incomes and asset prices support further borrowing and spending on
goods and financial assets. The borrowing essentially lifts spending and incomes above the consistent productivity
growth of the economy. Near the peak of the upward cycle, lending is based on the expectation that the above-trend
growth will continue indefinitely. But, of course, that can’t happen; eventually income will fall below the cost of the
loans.

中：在正常情况下，贷款会产生一个自我强化的上升运动，到顶峰后转而向下，进行一个自我强化的下降运动，触底后又逆转向上。在上升过程中，贷款支撑支出和投资，
进而推动收入增加，资产价格上涨。收入增加和资产涨价会导致进一步借债，扩大在商品和金融资产上的支出。借债基本上会将支出和收入提升至超出经济生产力稳步增长所对应的水平。
接近债务周期的顶峰时，人们预期以贷款维持的经济会继续以超越趋势的速度发展下去。这当然是不可能发生的，收入终将降至贷款成本以下。

---

英： Economies whose growth is significantly supported by debt-financed building of fixed investments, real estate, and
infrastructure are particularly susceptible to large cyclical swings because the fast rates of building those long-lived
assets are not sustainable. If you need better housing and you build it, the incremental need to build more housing
naturally declines. As spending on housing slows down, so does housing’s impact on growth. Let’s say you have been
spending $10 million a year to build an office building (hiring workers, buying steel and concrete, etc.). When the
building is finished, the spending will fall to $0 per year, as will the demand for workers and construction materials.
From that point forward, growth, income, and the ability to service debt will depend on other demand. This type of
cycle—where a strong growth upswing driven by debt-financed real estate, fixed investment, and infrastructure spending
is followed by a downswing driven by a debt-challenged slowdown in demand—is very typical of emerging economies because
they have so much building to do.

中：一些经济体的增长严重依赖借债进行固定资产投资、房地产和基础设施建设，这些经济体尤其会受到大规模周期性波动的影响，因为那些长期资产的快速建设是不可持续的。
如果国家需要改善住房，那么住房建设的增量需求自然会随着住房的建成而下降。随着住房支出增速放缓，住房对经济增长的影响也会减小。
假设你要建造一座办公大楼，在大楼建设期间，你的年均支出为1 000万美元（用于雇用工人，购买钢筋和混凝土等）。大楼竣工后，年均支出将降至0美元，
对工人和建筑材料的需求也将降至0美元。届时，经济增长、收入和偿债能力将取决于其他需求。债务融资的房地产、固定投资和基础设施建设拉动经济强劲增长，
之后需求增速放缓，债务挑战出现，从而导致经济下行。这类周期常常出现在新兴经济体，因为新兴经济体存在大量的建设需求。

---

英：Contributing further to the cyclicality of emerging countries’ economies are changes in their competitiveness due to
relative changes in their incomes. Typically, they have very cheap labor and bad infrastructure, so they build
infrastructure, have an export boom, and experience rising incomes. But the rate of growth due to exports naturally
slows as their income levels rise and their wage competitiveness relative to other countries declines. There are many
examples of these kinds of cycles (i.e., Japan’s experience over the last 70 years).

中：进一步推动新兴经济体周期性发展的因素是收入水平的相对变化所带来的竞争力变化。通常情况下，新兴经济体的劳动力非常廉价，基础设施极不完善，
因此它们热衷于进行基础设施建设，增加出口，提高国民收入水平。但随着这些国家的收入水平提高，其工资的相对竞争力会下降，出口增长率自然会放缓。
这类周期的例子有很多（例如，过去70年日本所经历的经济周期）。

---

英：In “bubbles,” the unrealistic expectations and reckless lending results in a critical mass of bad loans. At one stage
or another, this becomes apparent to bankers and central bankers and the bubble begins to deflate. One classic warning
sign that a bubble is coming is when an increasing amount of money is being borrowed to make debt service payments,
which of course compounds the borrowers’ indebtedness.

中：在泡沫阶段，不计后果的贷款和不切实际的预期带来大量无法偿还的债务。在某个时间点，这种状况会被商业银行和中央银行察觉，泡沫开始收缩。
泡沫形成的一个典型表现是：越来越多的借款被用来还债，导致借款人债务负担加剧。

---

英：When money and credit growth are curtailed and/or higher lending standards are imposed, the rates of credit growth
and spending slow and more debt service problems emerge. At this point, the top of the upward phase of the debt cycle is
at hand. Realizing that credit growth is dangerously fast, the central banks tighten monetary policy to contain it,
which often accelerates the decline (though it would have happened anyway, just a bit later). In either case, when the
costs of debt service become greater than the amount that can be borrowed to finance spending, the upward cycle
reverses. Not only does new lending slow down, but the pressure on debtors to make their payments is increased. The
clearer it becomes that debtors are struggling, the less new lending there is. The slowdown in spending and investment
that results slows down income growth even further, and asset prices decline.

中：一旦资金和信贷增长被遏制，或者贷款标准提高，那么信贷和支出增速就会放缓，偿债问题就会加速涌现，这时就接近于债务周期的顶部。
同时，央行意识到信贷增长过快，已经到了危险的地步，于是开始收紧货币政策，遏制信贷增长，进而导致债务周期加速下滑（即使央行不采取措施，债务周期也会下滑，
只是下滑的时间会推迟一些而已）。无论在哪种情况下，当偿债成本（即还本付息的成本）超过维持支出的借款时，债务上升周期就会逆转。不仅新增贷款的增速放缓，
借款人的还款压力也会增加，还本付息明显难以为继，新增贷款进一步减少。支出和投资增速的放缓导致收入增长进一步放缓，资产价格下跌。

--- 

英：When borrowers cannot meet their debt service obligations to lending institutions, those lending institutions cannot
meet their obligations to their own creditors. Policy makers must handle this by dealing with the lending institutions
first. The most extreme pressures are typically experienced by the lenders that are the most highly leveraged and that
have the most concentrated exposures to failed borrowers. These lenders pose the biggest risks of creating knock-on
effects for credit worthy buyers and across the economy. Typically, they are banks, but as credit systems have grown
more dynamic, a broader set of lenders has emerged, such as insurance companies, non-bank trusts, broker-dealers, and
even special purpose vehicles.

中： 当借款人无法履行对贷款人的偿债义务时，这些贷款人就无法履行对其债权人的义务。决策者必须首先解决贷款人的问题。最极端的压力通常发生在高杠杆贷款人身上，
其对无法还款的借款人有着高度集中的敞口风险。这些贷款人给整体经济和信誉良好的借款人带来连锁反应的风险也最大。这些贷款人以银行为主，但随着信贷体系日趋活跃，
这些风险也扩展到更大范围的贷款人，例如保险公司、非银行信托、经纪自营商，乃至特殊目的公司。这样的债务周期通常会产生两类问题。

--- 

英：The two main long-term problems that emerge from these kinds of debt cycles are:

1. The losses arising from the expected debt service payments not being made. When promised debt service payments can’t
   be made, that can lead to either smaller periodic
   payments and/or the writing down of the value of the debt (i.e., agreeing to accept less than was owed.) If you were
   expecting an annual debt service payment of 4 percent and it comes in at 2 percent or 0 percent, there is that
   shortfall for each year, whereas if the debt is marked down, that year’s loss would be much bigger (e.g., 50
   percent).
2. The reduction of lending and the spending it was financing going forward. Even after a debt crisis is resolved, it is
   unlikely that the entities that borrowed too much can generate the same level of spending in the future that they had
   before the crisis. That has implications that must be considered.

中：这样的债务周期通常会产生两类问题：

1. 因借款人无法按期还本付息而产生损失。损失可能出现的形式有定期付款金额下降或债务价值减记（即同意接受低于欠款金额的还款），两种形式也有可能同时出现。
   例如，如果贷款人预期每年能从借款人那里获得4%的还本付息款，而最终只获得2%或0%，那么损失就是每年的还本付息款差额。如果债务价值被减记，则当年的损失会更大（可能会达到50%）
2. 贷款以及贷款所支撑的支出下降。即使债务危机得到解决，过分举债的实体未来也难以维持危机前的支出水平。这种情况会带来的影响不容忽视。

## 能否妥善管理大部分债务危机，避免出现严重问题？

(Can Most Debt Crises Be Managed so There Aren’t Big Problems?)

英：Sometimes these cycles are moderate, like bumps in the road, and sometimes they are extreme, ending in crashes. In
this study we examine ones that are extreme—i.e., all those in the last 100 years that produced declines in real GDP of
more than 3 percent. Based on my examinations of them and the ways the levers available to policy makers work, I believe
that it is possible for policy makers to manage them well in almost every case that the debts are denominated in a
country’s own currency. That is because the flexibility that policy makers have allows them to spread out the harmful
consequences in such ways that big debt problems aren’t really big problems. Most of the really terrible economic
problems that debt crises have caused occurred before policy makers took steps to spread them out. Even the biggest debt
crises in history (e.g., the 1930s Great Depression) were gotten past once the right adjustments were made. From my
examination of these cases, the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from：

1. the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority
2. the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others.

It is from a desire to help reduce these risks that I have written this study.

中：有些债务周期较为缓和，就像前行道路上遇到些许颠簸，有些则较为极端，甚至会导致车毁人亡。本书研究的均为在过去100年间发生的极端案例，也就是造成实际GDP降幅超过3%的债务危机。
通过研究这些危机本身和决策者可使用的政策工具，我发现在几乎所有的债务危机中，只要债务是以一国的本币计价，则决策者都有可能妥善处理。因为决策者拥有灵活性，可以把债务问题的不良影响分散到未来若干年，
这样债务问题就不是大问题。在大多数情况下，债务危机之所以导致了严重的经济问题，都是因为决策者未能及时采取措施将影响分散化。即使是历史上最大的几次债务危机（例如，20世纪30年代的大萧条），
假如决策者能够进行正确的政策调整，也可以顺利度过。案例研究表明，债务危机最大的风险不是来自债务本身，而是来自以下因素：

1. 决策者缺乏知识，或缺乏权威，难以做出正确的决策；
2. 整顿债务问题带来了一些政治后果，在惠及一些人的同时，损害了另一些人的利益。

我出版本书，正是为了降低这些因素的风险。


---
英：Having said that, I want to reiterate that

1. when debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather than one’s own currency, it is much harder for a country’s
   policy makers to do the sorts of things that spread out the debt problems
2. the fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that they are not extremely costly to some people.

中：话虽如此，我需要重申的是：

1. 当债务以外币而非本币计价时，一国决策者分散债务问题的难度将大大增加
2. 虽然债务危机可以得到妥善管理，但一定会有人为此付出惨痛的代价。

---

英：The key to handling debt crises well lies in policy makers’ knowing how to use their levers well and having the
authority that they need to do so, knowing at what rate per year the burdens will have to be spread out, and who will
benefit and who will suffer and in what degree, so that the political and other consequences are acceptable.
There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to the
income and cash flow levels that are required to service them:

1. Austerity (i.e., spending less)
2. Debtdefaults/restructurings
3. Thecentralbank“printingmoney”andmakingpurchases(orprovidingguarantees)
4. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less

中：管理债务危机的关键在于，决策者要知道如何充分运用自身的政策工具，并有采取政策措施的权力，他们要知道每年的债务分摊比率，了解债务分摊中何方受益，
何方受损，损益几何，从而令整顿债务问题的政治后果和其他后果尚可被接受。决策者可以采取以下4种政策措施，以降低债务与收入之间的比率和偿债总额与用于偿债的现金流之间的比率。

1. 财政紧缩（即减少支出）
2. 债务违约/重组
3. 央行印钞，购买资产（或提供担保）
4. 将资金和信贷从充足的领域转向不足的领域。

---

英：Each one of their levers has different impacts on the economy. Some are inflationary and stimulate growth (e.g.,
“printing money”), while others are deflationary and help reduce debt burdens (e.g., austerity and defaults). The key to
creating a “beautiful deleveraging” (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation and growth
rates, which I explain later) lies in striking the right balance between them. In this happy scenario, debt-to-income
ratios decline at the same time that economic activity and financial asset prices improve, gradually bringing the
nominal growth rate of incomes back above the nominal interest rate.

中：以上每类措施对经济都有不同的影响。一些措施具有通胀性，会刺激经济增长（例如，央行印钞），而另一些措施具有通缩性，有利于减轻债务负担（例如，财政紧缩、债务违约）。
和谐的去杠杆化（降低债务与收入比率，同时保持适当的经济增长率和通胀率，下文将解释）关键在于均衡使用这些措施。在这种和谐的情境中，经济活力和金融资产价格得到改善，
同时债务与收入的比率下降，从而逐渐使名义收入增长率回升至名义利率之上。

英：These levers shift around who benefits and who suffers, and over what amount of time. Policy makers are put in the
politically difficult position of having to make those choices. As a result, they are rarely appreciated, even when they
handle the debt crisis well.

中：这些措施会带来不同的受益方和受损方，每项措施对经济的影响延续的时间也不同。决策者因此在政治上置身于困难的境地，要做出艰难的抉择，
这令他们即使可以很好地应对债务危机，也很少受到赞赏。
